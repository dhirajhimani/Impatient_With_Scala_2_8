[The JavaBeans specification has the notion of a property change listener , a standardized way for beans to communicate changes in their properties. The PropertyChangeSupport class is provided as a convenience superclass for any bean that wishes to support property change listeners. Unfortunately, a class that already has another superclass—such as JComponent —must reimplement the methods. Reimplement PropertyChangeSupport as a trait, and mix it into the java.awt.Point class.](src/main/scala/com/basile/scala/ch10/Ex05.scala)

[In the Java AWT library, we have a class Container , a subclass of Component that collects multiple components. For example, a Button is a Component , but a Panel is a Container . That’s the composite pattern at work. Swing has JComponent and JContainer , but if you look closely, you will notice something strange. JComponent extends Container , even though it makes no sense to add other components to, say, a JButton . The Swing designers would have ideally preferred the design in Figure 10–4 . Figure 10–4.

[Define an unapplySeq operation for the RichFile class that extracts all path segments. For example, for the file /home/cay/readme.txt , you should produce a sequence of three segments: home , cay , and readme.txt.](src/main/scala/com/basile/scala/ch11/Ex10.scala)
